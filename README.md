# Dices
A simple Android app for throwing dices, made as an assignment for the Android Dev Academy. It is supposed to simulate the 
behavior on the popular game Yamb.

- tapping on the first button generates six random dice values
- tapping on any dice locks its value (prevents it from being randomized)
- tapping on the second button removes lock from all dices
